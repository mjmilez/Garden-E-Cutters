- Debugged UART connection between GPS module and shears ESP32  
- Fixed NMEA reception issues by setting a common baud rate  
- Improved CSV print function to efficiently inspect recent GPS data during debugging  

**Next step:**  
- Update save task to wait for a `$GNGGA` UART sentence before attempting a save, removing the need for repeated save triggers
