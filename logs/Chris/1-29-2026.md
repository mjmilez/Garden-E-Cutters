## Christian Veltchev - 1/29/2026 Lab Day

**Things Accomplished:** 
- Researched ArcGIS to verify its viability and usability, ended up going with another map software called Leaflet.js
- Decided that if we want a proper interactive map, we need more storage and resources and thus decided to move to a Rasberry Pi
- Total Working time: 4 hours

**Next step(s):**  
- Test and implement Leaflet.js on local copmuter to visualize UI and plan the infrastursture so that its able to maximize the resources on Rasberry Pi
- Work on Alpha Build Doc
