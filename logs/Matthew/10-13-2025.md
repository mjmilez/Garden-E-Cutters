## Research on geolocation solutions
### Important Findings
- standard gps is 3-10 meters accuracy, which is not accurate enough.
- Dynamic gps is better to about 0.3-1 meter accuracy, still not exactly the best
- RTK gps is 1-2 centimeter accuracy. This is what we want but it comes with the tradeoff of $$$
