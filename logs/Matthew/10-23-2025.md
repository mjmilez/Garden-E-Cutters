## created accuracy to cost ratio
- This was to determine how we which option we would finally chose

Field small/medium (so UWB anchor network ≈ 8 anchors).

Anchor module price ≈ $70 each (mid-range).

UWB tag ≈ $50.

RTK rover (per-shear) ≈ $300 (NEO-F9P / u-blox class).

RTK base station ≈ $400 (mid-range; could be $250–$750).

Basic GNSS (consumer) module ≈ $30 (phone-style GNSS).

DGPS/SBAS-capable receiver ≈ $100 (board that uses WAAS/EGNOS corrections).

IMU ≈ $25 (BNO085 / similar).

Small field server / gateway ≈ $200 (Pi + LTE / router).

Accuracy numbers are typical real-world expectations:

GPS (consumer): ~5 m (median; 3–10 m typical)

DGPS/SBAS: ~0.3–1.0 m (use 0.5 m)

UWB (well deployed): ~0.10–0.30 m (use 0.15 m)

RTK GNSS: ~0.01–0.03 m (use 0.02 m = 2 cm)

Hybrid (RTK+UWB fused): uses RTK where available (2 cm) and UWB for GNSS outages — main benefit is robustness, not smaller nominal error than RTK.
