# What I did 2026-01-29 14:43

- Got the dev environment working again on my computer
- Created clear functionality on holding button for two seconds
- I also noticed a bug where sometimes when you press the button it would not log the time.
- Based on this I decided to look over the code and found that we are just hoping the gga sentence is after the button press. This was causing the bug.
- I decided to write functionality to arm for the next GGA sentence coming. This made sure that a location is always logged no matter what. We are not moving at super high speeds so this waiting for the next sentence is not critical.
