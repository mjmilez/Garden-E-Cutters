# What I did today

## Actions
- I breadboarded everything that would be in the shear box on one bread board.
- I added peripherals: 4 buttons (1 prime button, and 3 gps logging buttons), 1 LED for showing logging state, and a piezo for sound feedback.
- programmed pwm on gpio pins for piezo to make it louder.
- Fixed clear csv logic because it was not working sometimes.


## Research
- I looked into designs for encapsulating hardware.
- Thought about pcb designs for connecting the shears to the zed.
