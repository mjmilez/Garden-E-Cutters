## Researching tradeoffs between each geolocationing
### Table given from chatGpt to summarize findings
| System                                         |              Typical accuracy | Cost & complexity                   |                   Works in blocked LOS? | Good fit for your project?          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------- |
| **Standard GPS (single-freq)**                 |                        3–10 m | Low cost, low complexity            |                         Yes (satellite) | No — too coarse                     |
| **DGPS / SBAS (WAAS)**                         |                       0.3–1 m | Moderate                            | Yes, depends on correction availability | Possibly — borderline for 0.3–0.5 m |
| **RTK (GNSS RTK)**                             |          0.01–0.03 m (1–3 cm) | Higher cost, needs base & comms     |                     Needs good sky view | Excellent but more expensive        |
| **Local radio triangulation (RSSI)**           |     ~2–20 m (highly variable) | Low–moderate                        |                   Works indoors/blocked | Not suitable alone                  |
| **Local tower TDoA/AoA (general-purpose LPS)** |    0.5–2+ m (depends on tech) | Moderate-high, needs infrastructure |        Can work with LOS or partial LOS | Maybe — if carefully designed       |
| **UWB anchor network (local beacons)**         |         0.05–0.30 m (5–30 cm) | Moderate, simple anchors            |      Best with LOS but robust in fields | Very good — meets your goal         |
| **Hybrid: RTK + local anchors + IMU fusion**   | cm–submeter depending on mode | Highest complexity                  |                                  Robust | Best overall reliability            |

- UWB seems like a solid option to lower costs. We are considering this as an option.


- I think prices would be similar to RTK.
