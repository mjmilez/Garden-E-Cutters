## What I did

- Researched the data format of the zed-f9p chip
- Through the research, I realized that there is a design decision in this. There are different forms of gps data formats such as UBX, NMEA, etc.

- Moreover, I realized how that data would be sent in terms of hardware. Thinking we use i2C
